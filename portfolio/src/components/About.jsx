        <p>Hey there! My name is Nathaniel, and I like to design all sorts of things! 
        My creative interests vary, and I bounce between learning new development frameworks, UI tricks, and spending time writing. 
        I'm a firm believer in development as an outlet for our odd, creative passions and I love bringing ideas to life. 
        </p> 

        <br />     

        <p>I'm an almost-native Minnesotan, and away from my keyboard, I love hunting for my next great read in local book stores, hitting up weeknight trivia, and going for hikes in the woods! </p>

        <br />

        <p>
            My mission as a developer is to make fun, interactive, easy-to-use tools that engage users from first-glance.
            I'm naturally curious, passionate about sharing knowledge, and eternally expanding my skills.  
            Most importantly, I love injecting some whimsy into my creative process!
